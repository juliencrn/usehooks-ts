Add any EventListener with simplicity using this Hook.
It takes as parameters an `eventName`, a call-back function (`handler`), optionally a reference `element` and an `options` object to configure settings.

The `options` parameter is optional and can be used to configure the behavior and add some additional features.

- `throttle` (time in milliseconds) can be used to throttle the event listener handler by a specified amount of time.
  This can be useful to improve performance on resize and scroll events for example.
- `useVisualViewport` can be set to `true` to use the `visualViewport` instead of the `window` object as an event target.
  For more information refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/visualViewport).

The two examples down below showcase the Hook using `useRef` and an `window` based event.
