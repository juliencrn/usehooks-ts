This React Hook offers you an interface to toggle and read the dark theme mode between three values. It uses internally [`useLocalStorage()`](/react-hook/use-local-storage) to persist the value and listens the OS color scheme preferences.

Returned value

- The `isDarkMode` is a boolean to let you be able to use with your logic.
- The `ternaryModeCode` is a enum of string of type `"dark" | "system" | "light"`.

  When `ternaryModeCode` is set to `system`, the `isDarkMode` will use system theme, like in iOS and MacOS.

  Also, `ternaryModeCode` implicitly exports a type with `type TernaryDarkMode = typeof ternaryDarkMode`

Returned interface

- The `toggleTernaryDarkMode` is a function to toggle `ternaryModeCode` between `dark`, `system` and `light`.
- The `dispatchTernaryDarkMode` accepts a parameter of type `TernaryDarkMode` and set it as `ternaryModeCode`. If no parameter is passed, it will act as `toggleTernaryDarkMode`.
