A simple React Hook that helps you improve UX while images are loading. Rather than having an image that "unfolds" from top to bottom, we load a smaller version first which will be blurred and which will be replaced by the normal size image once loaded.

You can see an implementation of this hook on this website: [React Gallery](https://react-gallery-ux.netlify.app/). Don't hesitate to take the logic and write your own CSS instead.
