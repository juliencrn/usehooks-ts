React Hook for easy clipboard copy functionality.

This hook provides a simple method to copy a string to the [clipboard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/clipboard) and keeps track of the copied value. If the copying process encounters an issue, it logs a warning in the console, and the copied value remains null.
