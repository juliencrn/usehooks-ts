Very similar to the [`useInterval` ](/react-hook/use-interval) hook, this React hook implements the native [`setTimeout`](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_settimeout.asp) function keeping the same interface.

You can enable the timeout by setting `delay` as a `number` or disabling it using `null`.

When the time finish, the callback function called.
