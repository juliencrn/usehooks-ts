The React documentation says about `useLayoutEffect`:

> The signature is identical to useEffect, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations.

That means this hook is a browser hook. But React code could be generated from the server without the Window API.

If you're using NextJS, you'll have this error message:

> Warning: useLayoutEffect does nothing on the server, because its effect cannot be encoded into the server renderer's output format. This will lead to a mismatch between the initial, non-hydrated UI and the intended UI. To avoid this, useLayoutEffect should only be used in components that render exclusively on the client. See https://reactjs.org/link/uselayouteffect-ssr for common fixes.

This hook fixes this problem by switching between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect` following the execution environment.
