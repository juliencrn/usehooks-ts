Simple hook that enhances native `useState` with a callback function.

Example of usage :
React-query useQuery that we don't want to trigger on mount and relying on a state.

Basically you would:

1. Update the state
2. trigger useEffect hook with state as dep
3. trigger useQuery refetch

But what if you want to control when the refetch function is called ( not at each state change )?
Here's come the useStateSync hook that offer total control on state change callback.
