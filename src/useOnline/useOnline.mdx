A simple hook to check the user is online or not. This hook uses the native javascript apis to check user connectivity.
The returned value (`useOnline`) is a boolean to let you be able to use with your logic.

It uses internally [`useEventListener()`](/react-hook/use-event-listener) and [`useSsr()`](/react-hook/use-ssr) to get user online status.
