This is a React hook for listening to changes in the DOM tree using the [`MutationObserver` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)

You can listen to changes in node attributes or when a node is added or removed from the DOM, like when a modal opens and closes.

It takes a ref element (from `useRef()`) and optionally accepts all arguments from the [native `MutationObserver` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver/observe#options).

It returns an object with [`MutationRecord`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationRecord) list and a `getMutationListByType()` function as properties.
